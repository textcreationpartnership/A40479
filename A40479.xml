            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Merry Jeſt OF THE FRIER and the BOY.</head>
            <l>THere was a man in my Countrie</l>
            <l>Who in his life had wifes three,</l>
            <l>A blesſing full of joy.</l>
            <l>By his firſt wife a child he had,</l>
            <l>Which was a pretty ſturdy lad,</l>
            <l>A good unhappy boy.</l>
            <l>His father lov'd him very well,</l>
            <l>But his ſtep-mother never a deal:</l>
            <l>I tell you as I think.</l>
            <l>All things ſhe thought loſt by the Rood,</l>
            <l>Which might the boy do any good,</l>
            <l>As either meat or drink.</l>
            <l>And yet, I wis, it was but bad,</l>
            <l>Nor half enough thereof he had,</l>
            <l>But evermore the worſt.</l>
            <l>And therefore evil might ſhe fare,</l>
            <l>That wrought the little boy ſuch care,</l>
            <l>So far-forth as ſhe durſt.</l>
            <l>Vnto the man the wife can ſay,</l>
            <l>I would yt put this boy away,</l>
            <l>And that right ſoon in haſte.</l>
            <l>Truely he is a wicked lad,</l>
            <l>I would ſome other man him had,</l>
            <l>That would him better chaſte.</l>
            <l>Then ſaid the good-man: Dame not ſo,</l>
            <l>I will not let the young boy go,</l>
            <l>He's but of tender age:</l>
            <l>He ſhall with me this year abide,</l>
            <l>Till he be grown more ſtrong and try'd,</l>
            <l>For to win better wage.</l>
            <l>We have a man a ſturdy lout,</l>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47393:3"/>
            <l>Who keeps our neat the fields about,</l>
            <l>And ſleepeth all the day.</l>
            <l>He ſhall bid home, as God me ſhield,</l>
            <l>And Iack ſhall paſs into the field,</l>
            <l>To keep them; if he may.</l>
            <l>Then ſaid the wife in variment,</l>
            <l>Husband thereto I give conſent,</l>
            <l>For that I think it need.</l>
            <l>On the morrow when it was day,</l>
            <l>The little boy went on his way.</l>
            <l>Towards the fields with ſpeed:</l>
            <l>Of no man took he any care,</l>
            <l>But ſung, Hay ho, away the mure,</l>
            <l>With mirth he did purſue,</l>
            <l>Forward he drew with might and main</l>
            <l>Vntil he came amidſt the plain,</l>
            <l>And then his dinner drew,</l>
            <l>But when he ſaw it was ſo bad,</l>
            <l>Full little liſt thereto he had,</l>
            <l>And put it up from his fight.</l>
            <l>Saying: He had no will to taſte,</l>
            <l>And that his hunger ſtill ſhould laſt,</l>
            <l>Till he came home at night.</l>
            <l>Now as the boy ſat on a hill,</l>
            <l>There came an old man him untill,</l>
            <l>Was walking by the way:</l>
            <l>Who ſaid: My ſon, now God thee ſee,</l>
            <l>Full welcome, Father, may ye be,</l>
            <l>The little boy did ſay.</l>
            <l>The old man ſaid: I hunger ſore:</l>
            <l>Iack, haſt thou any meat in ſtore,</l>
            <l>Which thou mayſt give to me.</l>
            <l>The boy reply'd: So God me ſave,</l>
            <l>To ſuch poor victuals as I have,</l>
            <l>Right welcome you ſhall be.</l>
            <l>Of this the old man was full glad,</l>
            <l>The boy drew forth ſuch as he had,</l>
            <l>And ſaid: Go to gladly.</l>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47393:3"/>
            <l>The old man eaſie was to pleaſe,</l>
            <l>He ate, and made himſelf at eaſe,</l>
            <l>Saying: Son, gramercy.</l>
            <l>And for the meat thou gave to me,</l>
            <l>I will give three things unto thee,</l>
            <l>What e're thou wilt intreat.</l>
            <l>Then ſaid the Boy, the beſt I know,</l>
            <l>Is that ye give to me a bow,</l>
            <l>With which I birds may get,</l>
            <l>A bow, my ſon I ſhall thee give</l>
            <l>The which ſhall laſt while thou doſt live,</l>
            <l>Yea never bow nor break:</l>
            <l>For if thou ſhoot therein all day,</l>
            <l>Walking or winking any way,</l>
            <l>The mark ſtill thou ſhalt hit.</l>
            <l>Now when the bow in hand he felt,</l>
            <l>And had arrows under his belt,</l>
            <l>He merry was, I wiſs:</l>
            <l>And ſaid, had I a pipe withal,</l>
            <l>Though never ſo little nor ſo ſmall,</l>
            <l>I had all that I wiſh.</l>
            <l>A pipe ſon, thou ſhalt haue alſo,</l>
            <l>Which in true muſick ſo ſhall go,</l>
            <l>I put thee out of doubt:</l>
            <l>That whoſoever ſhall it hear,</l>
            <l>Shall have no power to forbear,</l>
            <l>But laugh and leap about.</l>
            <l>Now tell me what the third ſhall be,</l>
            <l>For three things will I give to thee,</l>
            <l>As I have ſaid before.</l>
            <l>The boy then ſmiling, anſwer made,</l>
            <l>I have enough for my poor trade,</l>
            <l>And will deſire no more.</l>
            <l>The old man ſaid, my troath is plight,</l>
            <l>Thou ſhalt have all I thee beheght,</l>
            <l>Say on now let me ſee.</l>
            <l>At home I have, the boy reply'd,</l>
            <l>A truel ſtep-mother full of pride,</l>
            <l>Who is moſt curſt to me.</l>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47393:4"/>
            <l>When meat my father gives to me.</l>
            <l>She wiſhes poiſon it might be,</l>
            <l>And ſtareth in my face,</l>
            <l>Now when ſhe gazeth on me ſo,</l>
            <l>I wiſh ſhe might a fart let go,</l>
            <l>That might ring through the place.</l>
            <l>The old man anſwered then anon,</l>
            <l>When that ſhe looks thy face upon,</l>
            <l>Her tail ſhall wind the horn.</l>
            <l>So loudly that who ſhall it hear,</l>
            <l>Shall not be able to forbear,</l>
            <l>But laugh her unto ſcorn.</l>
            <l>So farewel ſon, the old man cry'd,</l>
            <l>God keep you ſir, the boy reply'd,</l>
            <l>I take my leave of thee.</l>
            <l>And he that beſt of all things may,</l>
            <l>Protect thee ſafe both night and day,</l>
            <l>Gramercy, ſon, ſaid he.</l>
            <l>When it grew near into the night,</l>
            <l>Iack well adviſ'd, hy'd home full right:</l>
            <l>It was his ordinance:</l>
            <l>And as he went his pipe did blow,</l>
            <l>The whilſt his cattle on a row.</l>
            <l>About him faſt did dance.</l>
            <l>This to the town he pyps full trim,</l>
            <l>His skipping beaſts do follow him,</l>
            <l>Into his fathers cloſe.</l>
            <l>He went and put them up each one,</l>
            <l>Then went into the houſe anone</l>
            <l>Into the hall he goes.</l>
            <l>His father at his Supper ſat</l>

            <l>My dinner was but ill.</l>
            <l>His father took a capons wing,</l>

            <l>The Proctors flung the hills about,</l>

            <l>Perfuming all the mirth.</l>
            <l>The Sumners as they had been wood,</l>
            <l>Leapt o'r the forms and ſeats ſo good,</l>
            <l>And wallowed on the earth.</l>
            <l>Wenches that for their pennance came,</l>

            <l>Some broke their heads, and ſome their ſhin,</l>
            <l>And ſome their noſes braſt.</l>
            <l>The Official thus ſore turmoild,</l>
            <l>Half ſwelt with ſweat, and almoſt ſpoil'd</l>

            <l>The Official and the Sumner.</l>
            <l>The ſtep-dame, and the wicked Frier,</l>
